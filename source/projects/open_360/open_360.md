open360 is an open-source 360Â° camera based on the [NXP 8M plus](https://www.nxp.com/products/processors-and-microcontrollers/arm-processors/i-mx-applications-processors/i-mx-8-applications-processors/i-mx-8m-plus-arm-cortex-a53-machine-learning-vision-multimedia-and-industrial-iot:IMX8MPLUS) processor. With its integrated neural processing unit (NPU) the goal is to map surveillance cameras on device in a compact form factor.
