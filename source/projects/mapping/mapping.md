# mapping

unsurv offers multiple ways to map public surveillance cameras in a privacy focused way.

Check out

- [unsurv-mapping](https://github.com/unsurv/unsurv-mapping) for a lightweight android app focused on manual mapping
- [unsurv-android](https://github.com/unsurv/unsurv-android) for an extensive android app including a retrained Tensorflow object detection model to automatically detect two types of surveillance cameras
- [camera-evaluation](https://github.com/unsurv/camera-evaluation) a basic browser based evaluation software to check if OpenStreetMap already has a database entry for a mapped camera.
