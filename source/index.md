# unsurv documentation

unsurv started as a project concerned with biometric surveillance and its dangers. You will find different hardware/software projects working on detecting, mapping and quantifying potential biometric surveillance cameras as well as projects that originated from technologies met along the way.

Feel free to contact me if you have any requests, suggestions, ideas for collaboration.
